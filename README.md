# Iliadbot

## Experiments in botwriting regarding the Iliad.

To get your local copy running, download a copy of the Iliad from Project Gutenberg with`sh downloadiliad.sh`

You can then strip out everything besides the verses using `perl parseiliad.pl`.

Proceed to building a markov table with `iliadmarkov.js`.

An intermediate representation will then be stored in `iliadmarkov.json`.
